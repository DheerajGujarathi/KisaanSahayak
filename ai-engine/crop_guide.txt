Tomato:
Tomatoes need well-drained loamy soil with pH 6.0–6.8.
They require 6-8 hours of sunlight daily.
Fertilize with nitrogen-rich compost during early growth.
Water at the base to prevent leaf diseases.
Common pests: Aphids, Whiteflies.
Control pests with neem oil spray.
Harvest when fruits are firm and fully red.

Wheat:
Wheat prefers cool temperatures between 10°C to 24°C.
Sow seeds in rows 20 cm apart for best yield.
Irrigate lightly after sowing and at critical stages (tillering, heading).
Apply balanced NPK fertilizer.
Major disease: Rust. Use rust-resistant varieties.
Harvest when grains turn golden yellow and hard.

Rice:
Rice requires standing water for most of its growing season.
Maintain 5–10 cm water level in paddy fields.
Use high-yielding varieties suitable for your region.
Apply urea in three splits: basal, tillering, and panicle initiation.
Watch for pests like Brown Plant Hopper.
Drain water before harvesting.
Harvest when grains turn yellow and are hard.

Potato:
Potatoes grow best in cool weather, loose and well-drained soil.
Plant seed tubers with eyes facing up, 10 cm deep.
Irrigate regularly but avoid waterlogging.
Use potash-rich fertilizers to improve tuber quality.
Common disease: Late blight. Use copper-based fungicide.
Harvest when plants dry up and tuber skins harden.

Mango:
Mango trees need deep, well-drained soil and a warm climate.
Irrigate during flowering and fruit development.
Use farmyard manure and micronutrients to boost flowering.
Prune after harvesting to encourage new growth.
Watch for fruit fly attacks; use pheromone traps.
Harvest fruits when they start turning yellow and emit aroma.

General Tips:
Crop rotation helps improve soil health.
Mulching conserves soil moisture and suppresses weeds.
Integrated pest management (IPM) reduces chemical use.
Timely sowing and proper spacing improve yield.
Soil testing before sowing helps choose the right fertilizers.
